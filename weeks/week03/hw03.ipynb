    "Answer 1: From previous data, we have evidence that the “C” allele of Nxf1 allowed a higher level of target gene RNA expression than the “B” allele in 6 out of 7 cases. In order to check if this correlation holds true for the 8th gen as well, we need to perform a one-sided test such that the null hypothesis would be- There is no correlation between Nxf1 allele and expression of 8th gene and alternate hypothesis would be- \"C\" allele of Nxf1 is correlated with higher expression of 8th gene as compared to \"B\" allele."

    "Answer 2: I would use the mean of expression level of gene with \"B\" allele of Nxf1 (Ub) and \"C\" allele of Nxf1 (Uc) as my test-statistic for this test. This is because the overall increase or decrease in expression can be represented by increase or decrease in  mean in the presence of a particular allele of Nxf1.\n",
